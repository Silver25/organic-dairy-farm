## Deployment

### Local Deployment

To test and view HTML5 and CSS3 project locally, a simple server environment needs to be set up on personal computer. This essentially mimics a web hosting service, but runs on private machine. Let's walk through the steps involved...  
- Choose a code editor of your preference like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or Brackets. These editors provide syntax highlighting and other functionalities for web development.
- Organize your HTML and CSS files in a *folder structure*. Typically, you'll have an index.html file as your main webpage and other HTML files for different sections. CSS files can be in a separate CSS folder. All together can be placed in the *My Documents* subfolder on Windows.
- As HTML and CSS are languages easily interpreted in the browser of choice, once index.html file is created it's content can be displayed opening that file in browser
- For everything to work and display properly attention needs to be on using of *relative path* code structure
- Test the layout and functionality on different browsers (*Portable Browsers*).
- Use the browser's developer tools (*Inspect* or **F12**) to inspect and debug any styling issues.

Or to simplify if Repository for the project is already created on GitHub all content of the project can be downloaded over the action button and option "Download".

<p>If all of the changes are saved (CTRL+S) and content updated on GitHub (git push) download of full project is available over green button "Code" and option "Download ZIP"</p>
